 PHP is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML. PHP is an interpreted language. This means that when you make changes to your source code you can immediately test these changes, without first needing to compile your source code into binary form. Skipping the compilation step makes the development process much faster.
